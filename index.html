    <p style="text-align:center;"> Welcome to my website! This site has projects I've completed in ENGCMP 0610 during Spring 2025 at Pitt. These projects inlcude an audio narrative podcast, and a video essay.</p>
<p>The composition process for this website was interesting for me because I had never worked with HTML or CSS. In making the website, I looked at a lot of other peoples portfolios to look at what was possible with my own abilities. I took design info from them, but I also watched YouTube videos to generate ideas for what to include and how to code it. </p>
<p>For the audio narrative, I used Audacity. I had used Audacity in a previous class where I also made a podcast, so it was fun returning to this medium and improving my audio editing skills. I chose Duolingo because I think they&#39;re a very interesting company and there are many pros and cons to their business practices, making audio a good format to discuss this. </p>
    
<p>For the video essay, I had some experience with Premiere Rush but not Premiere Pro. I&#39;ve edited shorter videos around 1-2 minutes but editing a full video essay was something new to me. I watch a lot of video essays so it was great to combine my love of watching them with creativity and creating one of my own. </p>
    
<p>Overall, I enjoy editing so it was enjoyable getting to edit pieces of media that were about topics I&#39;m passionate about and had prior thoughts on. </p>
