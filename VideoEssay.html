<h2><div class="header"> Summary </div></h2>
<p> The thesis of this video is how the pet-to-threat phenomenon affects Black women in corporate spaces, and applies this phenomenon to the character Harper Stern in HBO’s Industry. The pet-to-threat phenomenon is a term used to describe attitudes towards Black women throughout their career in corporate environments. They begin as the “office pet,” being acknowledged and appreciated, but underutilized. Then overtime Black women are viewed as the “office threat,” and often are ignored and isolated by their co-workers. Harper in Industry isn’t the only person of color at Pierpoint, but she is the only Black woman and this distinction makes her an outsider. </p>
<p>Because Industry is a TV show, and this video essay deals with race, having visuals to explain characters and interactions make it a lot easier for the viewer to understand if they’ve never seen the show before. Pet-to-threat isn’t a TV theory but rather a social/racial one, so I was also able to bring in different perspectives and real-world examples of the phenomenon. </p>
<p> My peers gave great feedback on how my essay could be more clear and my thesis more refined. I thought creating this essay was a lot of fun, but the hard part was narrowing down what exactly I wanted to say and wanted the viewers to take away. I knew I wanted to make a video about Industry but didn’t know about the pet-to-threat phenomenon until I started researching for this essay. My peers also said they didn’t know about this theory so it was great to be able to make something informative that people didn’t know about previously. </p>
