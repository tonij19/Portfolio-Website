    <h1> Podcast: The Rise and Fall of Duolingo </h1>

<h2> Summary </h2>

<p>This podcast takes a look at how Duolingo has evolved from a start-up to a multi-million dollar company. What began as a free language learning resource is now recognized by over 5000 universities as an official language exam for English. As a language learner who has used Duolingo casually, many of the app's changes haven’t been received positively. In example, the app is no longer completely free, with many resources locked behind a paywall.</p>

<p>For me, the biggest offense has been the companies shift to prioritizing AI usage over user wants and needs. The company uses AI both as a paid offering for users, but also a tool to generate their official lesson plans. This article from the Washington Post has quotes from former translators/employees who believe they were replaced with AI. Many jobs and fields are threatened by AI, and Duolingo’s contribution to this threat has not gone unnoticed. </p>

<p>I used audio to create a soundscape but also to tell a story that very much doesn’t rely on visuals. Though Duolingo is visually iconic, what makes a great podcast is often a boring video essay. I tried having a variety of audio, from interviews to language learning audio courses from YouTube. </p>

<P>Many of the edits I made throughout this process were technical, including the audio used, and especially the volume of my sound-effects and placements of transitions. My story became clearer the more I worked on it, especially because I created a script beforehand. The podcast largely reflects my script besides 1-2 last minute additions. </p>
