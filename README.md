# Portfolio Website
 
This site is my final portfolio for ENGCMP0610: Compositing Digital Media. I've linked my audio narrative project, as well as my video essay. Both pages have more details about my process and the sources I used. The site also has room to include more if I choose to add something in the future. This was my first time coding a website so a lot of the work I did was visualizing what I actually wanted the website to look like/features and sections that I wanted to include. Overall, Iâ€™m happy with my work!
